\n - CONFIG\
\n   .Define the parameters under config.mk\n\
\n - SETUP\
\n   .Run "make setup" to setup the folder structure\
\n   .Write TOP?="top_name" parameter in the config.mk\
\n    file to properly set the TOP module\n\
\n - HJSON\
\n   .Run "make hjson" to initialize the configuration file \
\n    for CSR registers and documentation under data/ folder. \
\n   .Update it for your needs\n\
\n - DOC\
\n   .Run "make doc" to generate the documentation based on \
\n    the configuration file.\n\
\n - REG\
\n   .Run "make reg" to generate CSR register with TLUL interface \
\n    based on the configuration file.\n\
\n - RTL SKELETON\n\

\n    synthetized correctly\n\
\n - SDF\
\n   .Run "make sdf" to generate sdf files\n\
\n - STATIC TIMING ANALYSIS\
\n   .Run "make sdf" to perform basic static timing\
\n    analysis with OpenSTA \n\
